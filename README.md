- To run coffeescript code on your server - keep in mind you need node.js to be installed too maybe
 https://nodejs.org/

Installation

The CoffeeScript compiler is itself written in CoffeeScript, using the Jison parser generator. The command-line version of coffee is available as a Node.js utility. The core compiler however, does not depend on Node, and can be run in any JavaScript environment, or in the browser (see "Try CoffeeScript", above).

To install, first make sure you have a working copy of the latest stable version of Node.js. You can then install CoffeeScript globally with npm:

npm install -g coffee-script

When you need CoffeeScript as a dependency, install it locally:

npm install --save coffee-script

If you'd prefer to install the latest master version of CoffeeScript, you can clone the CoffeeScript source repository from GitHub, or download the source directly. To install the latest master CoffeeScript compiler with npm:

npm install -g jashkenas/coffeescript

Or, if you want to install to /usr/local, and don't want to use npm to manage it, open the coffee-script directory and run:

sudo bin/cake install
